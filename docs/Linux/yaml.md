# YAML

YAML was first proposed by Clark Evans in 2001, who designed it together with Ingy d√∂t Net[1] and Oren Ben-Kiki.

Originally YAML was said to mean Yet Another Markup Language, referencing its purpose as a markup language with the yet another construct, but it was then repurposed as YAML Ain't Markup Language, a recursive acronym, to distinguish its purpose as data-oriented , rather than document markup.
